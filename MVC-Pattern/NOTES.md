## The MVC Pattern

### Model:

- Contains logic for interacting with your data and data storage

- e.g defines functions/methods for storing data in a database or fetching data from a database

### View:

- Contains logic for presenting data/content to the user

- Typically, that's your templates + the logic (e.g EJS tags) in there

### Controller:

- Connects models with views

- Typically connected to your routes
